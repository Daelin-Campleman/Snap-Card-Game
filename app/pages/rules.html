            <p>Players take turns to flip over a card from the deck in front of them.</p>
            <p>When your deck is highlighted, it is your turn to flip over a card. A card can be flipped over by clicking on the deck in front of you.</p>
            <p>If two cards with matching suits or value are flipped over right after each other, the first player to hit snap, gets the deck in the middle. 
                The deck in the middle then forms part of this player's deck.</p>
            <p>You hit snap by either clicking on the snap button or pressing the spacebar key.</p>
            <p>The first player who has the entire deck of 52 cards in front of them - so all other players have no cards in their decks - wins.</p>
